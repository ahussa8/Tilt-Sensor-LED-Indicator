# Tilt-Sensor-LED-Indicator
Built an Arduino-based tilt detection system using a pull-up resistor. Programmed two LEDs (green/red) to indicate tilt state based on sensor input. Serial monitor displays real-time status ("TILT" or "NO TILT"). Switched from external to internal pull-up resistor for streamlined wiring.
